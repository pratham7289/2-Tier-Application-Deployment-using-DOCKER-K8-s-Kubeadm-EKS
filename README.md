# 2-Tier Application Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps to deploy a 2-tier application consisting of Flask as the frontend and backend, and MySQL as the database, in various environments including Docker, Kubernetes (using kubeadm), and AWS EKS.

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy a 2-tier application on various platforms, including Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS. The application comprises a Flask frontend and backend connected to a MySQL database.

## Deployment Steps

### Docker Deployment

1. Clone the code from GitHub and navigate to the cloned directory.
2. Build the Docker images for the Flask application and MySQL database.
3. Run the Docker containers for Flask and MySQL.
4. Set up networking to enable communication between the containers.
5. Access the application via the specified port.

### Kubernetes Deployment with Kubeadm

1. Provision EC2 instances for the Kubernetes cluster.
2. Set up Docker and dependencies on all nodes.
3. Configure the Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.
4. Deploy the application components using YAML manifest files.
5. Access the application using the assigned NodePort.

### Deployment on AWS EKS

1. Provision an EC2 instance to create the EKS cluster.
2. Install necessary tools and configure IAM roles.
3. Create the EKS cluster using eksctl.
4. Configure manifests for MySQL, deployment, and service.
5. Apply the manifests to deploy the application on EKS.
6. Access the application via the load balancer URL.

## Security Considerations

- Store sensitive information securely.
- Utilize Kubernetes Secrets or other secure management tools.
- Implement appropriate security measures for resource access.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement monitoring and logging solutions.
- Utilize Kubernetes-native tools or third-party solutions for observability.

## Troubleshooting

- Refer to common issues and resolutions.
- Use logging and monitoring tools for issue identification and resolution.
